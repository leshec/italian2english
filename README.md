## **Todo:**

- [ ] Favicon. What is the right way to do this? 
- [x] Finish the youtube walkthrough as is
- [x] Figure how to deploy with shuttle
- [ ] Use it to port some of my projects
- [ ] Make some notes for later
- [ ] maybe add styling in the layout rather than inline 


## **HTMX Web app**

- Web server: Rust with axum (https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) 
- HTML templating engine: tera (https://docs.rs/tera/latest/tera)
- Basic styling: missing.style (https://missing.style/)
- HTMX (https://htmx.org/)
- Hotreloading: cargo-watch (https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch)
- deployed via shuttle.rs, fairly easily
